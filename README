This version works on Songbird 2.0.0 but only with the demo song.

// INSTALL
# Put the 'songbirdvis' directory in your songbird extensions directory
	i.e ~/Library/Application\ Support/Songbird2/Profiles/8oe730k9.dev/extensions (on a Mac)
# Rename the 'songbirdvis' directory to 'songbirdvis@example.org'
# add the demo song to your Songbird library and play it: 'songbirdvis@example.org/chrome/content/data/01 - Baby One More Time.mp3'
# Select the 'Visualizer.fm' Media View.

// TODO: 
 * Fix echonest json decode function
 * get p.image working in processing.js
 * move to processing.js v0.9.1
 * Get visualizer.fm button to always be showing, and have an icon?
 * Change "Extension Loaded" text to Visualizer.fm or something like that.
